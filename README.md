# Codsoft
Welcome to the CodSoft Internship Projects repository! This repository contains Java projects developed during my internship at CodSoft, including an ATM Interface, Student Grade Calculator, Student Management System, Number Game, and Currency Converter. Each project has its directory with the necessary files. To run any project, clone the repository (`git clone https://github.com/yourusername/codsoft-internship-projects.git`), navigate to the respective project directory, compile the Java files (`javac <ProjectName>.java`), and run the compiled program (`java <ProjectName>`). Contributions are welcome through pull requests.
